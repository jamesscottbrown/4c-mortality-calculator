To deploy this, I previously ran `npm run deploy` from my desktop (which ued the [`gh-pages`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) npm package); there is now [a GitHub Action](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) that deploys from a push to master


## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and enzyme
npm run test
```
